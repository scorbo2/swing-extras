/**
 * This class encapsulates a PropertiesManager and an ExtensionManager together into
 * one handy utility that client projects can use more easily than the old approach
 * of having the client projects maintain these things separately.
 * <p>
 * <b>Enabling and disabling</b><br>
 * Both this class and ExtensionManager have methods for enabling and disabling an
 * extension. But ExtensionManager knows nothing about this class. This class therefore
 * tries to automatically reconcile these status flags across the two classes, and
 * generally you shouldn't need to worry about it. If an extension is enabled or
 * disabled in ExtensionManager, this class will notice the change and will enable
 * or disable all extension properties as needed. This means that you shouldn't see
 * properties from disabled extensions in the PropertiesDialog, but the values for
 * them will still be saved and loaded to the propsFile. When you re-enable an
 * extension, either in this class or in ExtensionManager, then its properties will
 * once again show up in the PropertiesDialog.
 * <p>
 * <b>Loading and saving</b><br>
 * Unlike sc-util 1.8, there's nothing wonky that client apps need to do in order
 * to load AppProperties and Extensions. You can simply invoke load() in this class
 * and it will all just work. Any extensions that were disabled the last time you
 * invoked save() will be correctly loaded in a disabled state - this means that their
 * property values will be loaded correctly, but they won't show up in the PropertiesDialog
 * until the extension is enabled again.
