/**
 * A generic abstract base class for property fields, to be used with PropertiesManager.
 * The available field types correspond pretty tightly to the available types in
 * the ca.corbett.forms.fields package.
 * <p>
 * The goal here is to make managing application preferences easy and
 * consistent across apps. Instead of each application having code to
 * load and save preferences, as well as provide a UI for the user to
 * view and change them, the classes in this package allow applications
 * to just define the preferences by type and name, and then you can
 * use PropertiesManager to handle the loading and saving of them,
 * and PropertiesDialog to handle the UI for them. The burden on the
 * application itself is MUCH lighter.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The naming of preferences is important for organizing preferences
 * into user-visible groups. Every property has a fully-qualified
 * dot-separated name that is used by this package to determine
 * what category a property belongs to. Refer to the constructor
 * for example usages.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: I use the terms "property" and "preference" pretty much
 * interchangeably throughout these docs. In hindsight maybe
 * I should have called these "Preferences".
