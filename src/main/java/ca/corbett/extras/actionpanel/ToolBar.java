 * A ToolBar can be optionally presented within an ActionGroup in an ActionPanel.
 * It can contain buttons for adding new items to the group, reordering items in
 * the group, removing items from the group, or removing the group itself.
 * All of this can be customized in ActionPanel.
 * <p>
 * This class is package-private, so callers do not
 * interact with it directly. Use the ActionPanel API instead.
