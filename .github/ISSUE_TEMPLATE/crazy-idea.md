**Description**
Describe the idea. Is it an incremental improvement on an existing feature, or is it a wild, outlandish idea for something brand new that would be really cool? Either way, describe the new feature, and explain why it would be cool.

**Note**
If you're describing a problem in an existing feature, please consider submitting a bug report instead. The exception to this rule is if the existing feature is too limited in some way, and potentially needs major changes to make it work better.
