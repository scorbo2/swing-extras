# swing-extras

This is swing-extras, a collection of custom components and utilities for Java Swing 
applications. I wrote this collection of code from around 2012 until around 2022, but
it was not publicly available until 2025. 

The library includes a demo application so you can try out the various components and
utilities within swing-extras:
